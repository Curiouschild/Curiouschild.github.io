Used OpenCV library to realize face detection and recognition. The system supported simultaneous multiple face detection and recognition. Used JavaFX Scene Builder to design system’s user interface and used CSS to embellish the application.

Maintained Students’ basic details and visiting records in an embedded Derby database. The system can generate analytic reports using these data for the admin staff.




VideoCapture read(Mat frame)
	The methods/functions combine VideoCapture::grab() and VideoCapture::retrieve() in one call. This is the most convenient method for reading video files or capturing data from decode and return the just grabbed frame.
