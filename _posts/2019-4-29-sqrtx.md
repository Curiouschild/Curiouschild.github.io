    Implement int sqrt(int x).

    Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

    Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the
    result is returned.

    Example 1:

    Input: 4
    Output: 2

    Example 2:

    Input: 8
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since
                 the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.



* Optimized Brutal Force: Reduce search Space

```java
public int mySqrt(int n) {
    long x = n;
    long y = x;
    while(x/2 * x/2 > y) {
        x /= 2;
    }
    for(long i = x / 2; i <= x; i++) {
        long j = i * i;
        if(j == y) return (int)i;
        else if(j > y) return (int)i-1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```
