[{{page.title}}](https://leetcode.com/problems/race-car/){:target="_blank"}

    Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.  (Your car can go into negative
    positions.)

    Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse).

    When you get an instruction "A", your car does the following: position += speed, speed *= 2.

    When you get an instruction "R", your car does the following: if your speed is positive then speed = -1 ,
    otherwise speed = 1.  (Your position stays the same.)

    For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0->1->3->3, and your speed goes to 1->2->4->-
    1.

    Now for some target position, say the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

    Example 1:
    Input:
    target = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
    Your position goes from 0->1->3.

    Example 2:
    Input:
    target = 6
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
    The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
    Your position goes from 0->1->3->7->7->6.

* Top Down DP with memo

```java

class Solution {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    public int racecar(int target) {
        return dp(target);
    }

    public int dp(int target) {
        if(map.containsKey(target)) return map.get(target);
        int n = 0;
        while((1 << n)-1 < target) n++;
        if((1 << n)-1 == target) {
            return n;
        }

        int result = n + 1 + dp((1 << n)-1 - target);
                    // A(n), R, dp
        for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            result = Math.min(result, n - 1 + 1 + i + 1 + dp(target - (1 << (n-1)) + (1 << i)));
                                    //A(n-1), Rï¼ŒA(i),R + dp
        }
        map.put(target, result);
        return result;
    }
  }
```
